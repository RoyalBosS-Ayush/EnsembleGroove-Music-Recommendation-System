# EnsembleGroove

EnsembleGroove is a music recommendation system that combines the power of Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms to provide accurate and diverse music recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

## Installation

To use EnsembleGroove, you'll need to have Python installed. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoyalBosS-Ayush/EnsembleGroove-Music-Recommendation-System.git
```

## Usage

### 1. Dataset

### 2. Jupyter Notebook

EnsembleGroove includes a Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) that provides an interactive environment to explore the recommendation system. Open the notebook in Jupyter and follow the instructions to run the code cells and generate music recommendations.
